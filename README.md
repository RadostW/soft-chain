# Soft-chain
Hydrodynamic properties of intrinsically disordered proteins in Rotne-Prager-SARW approximation.

# Package contents
This code can do three things:
1. Generate random, self-avoiding chains with specified step sizes.
2. Generate translational mobility matricies according to Rotne-Prager approximation
3. Compute effective hydrodynamic radius by ensemble average of mobility.

There is a webapp using the same backend with some visuals to make it easier to understand :candy:
